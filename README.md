# Supanote

Supanote is a minimal note taking application built with Next.js and
prepared for future integration with Supabase. It demonstrates a clean
application structure with TypeScript, React Context for state management
and Tailwind CSS for styling.

## Development

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Testing

```bash
npm test
npm run lint
```

The project currently stores notes in `localStorage`. A Supabase backend
can be added later in the context layer.
